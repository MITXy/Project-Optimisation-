# Resource Allocation Optimization for Bioenergy Production

This repository contains Matlab code for an optimization problem involving the allocation of resources to different locations for the production of bioenergy from sorghum, millet, rice, and soya beans. The optimization problem also considers the production of biodigeste and bioethanol from the biomass.

## Problem Statement

The problem is to allocate resources to six locations for the production of bioenergy from sorghum, millet, rice, and soya beans. The objective is to maximize the total energy produced while minimizing the cost of production. The problem is subject to constraints on the availability of resources, the capacity of the production facilities, and the demand for the energy products.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- `matlab_code`: A directory containing Matlab scripts for solving the optimization problem using linear programming techniques. The scripts use the Optimization Toolbox in Matlab to implement the optimization algorithm.

- `data`: A directory containing sample data files for the optimization problem. These files specify the resource availability, production facility capacity, and demand for energy products for each location.

- `results`: A directory containing the output files generated by the Matlab scripts. These files show the optimal allocation of resources and the energy production for each location.

- `LICENSE`: A file containing the license under which this repository is distributed (MIT License).

## Requirements

To run the Matlab scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Matlab (version R2016b or higher)
- Optimization Toolbox in Matlab

## Usage

To solve the optimization problem and generate the optimal allocation of resources and energy production, you can run the Matlab scripts in the `matlab_code` directory. The scripts use the sample data files in the `data` directory to specify the problem parameters and then solve the optimization problem using linear programming techniques.

The output files generated by the Matlab scripts will be saved in the `results` directory. These files show the optimal allocation of resources and energy production for each location.
